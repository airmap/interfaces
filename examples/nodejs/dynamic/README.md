This is an example of how to use dynamically loaded gRPC and dynamically-typed protobufs.

The example clients can be installed by running:
```sh
cd examples/nodejs/dynamic
npm install
```

The traffic processor client can then be run by:
```
node traffic_processor_client.js
```

The traffic provider client can then be run by:
```
node traffic_provider_client.js
```
