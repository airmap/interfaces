This is an example of how to use dynamically loaded gRPC and dynamically-typed protobufs.

The example clients can be installed by running:
```sh
cd examples/nodejs/dynamic/telemetry
npm install
```

The telemetry provider client can be run by:
```
EXPORT CLIENT_ID={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}
EXPORT CLIENT_SECRET={YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}
node provider.js
```
